# Trader Behavior Insights with Bitcoin Market Sentiment

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between trader performance and Bitcoin market sentiment using two datasets:

- **Historical Trader Data**: Includes trade details such as account, coin, execution price, closed PnL, and timestamp.
- **Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index**: Market sentiment scores categorized as Fear, Neutral, and Greed.

The objective is to uncover patterns linking trader profitability to market sentiment and provide insights to inform smarter trading strategies.

## Whatâ€™s Inside
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to align trade data with sentiment by date.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including visualizations of Closed PnL vs sentiment.
- Grouped analysis by trader accounts and coins to identify trends in profitability relative to market sentiment.
- Summary of insights that highlight how sentiment influences trading performance.
- (Optional) Recommendations for trading strategies based on observed patterns.

## How to Run
- Open the notebook (`Trader_Behavior_Insights.ipynb`) in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- Ensure required libraries are installed (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).
- Follow through the notebook cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
